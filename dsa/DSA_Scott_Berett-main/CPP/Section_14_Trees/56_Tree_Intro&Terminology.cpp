/*
 *  Tree can be mainly binary tree
 * 
 * 	a Binary  tree have 2 pointers : left and right  which is similar to linked list node which has only one pointer pointing to next node
 *
 * 
 *  A binary tree is full when EVERY NODE EITHER POINTS TO ZERO NODES OR TWO NODES.
 * 	A binary tree is perfect when level of nodes are complete or must not left vacant (OR) SIMPLY ANY LEVEL IN TREE THAT HAS ANY NODES IS COMPLETELY FILLED ALL THE WAY ACROSS
 *  A binary tree is complete when left side child filled up (OR) WITH A COMPLETE TREE YOU ARE FILLING THE TREE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT WITH NO GAPS.
 *  A PERFECT TREE IS BOTH COMPLETE AND FULL. 
 * 
 *  Child Node share the same parent are also called siblings and Every Node can have one parent.
 *  Child Node also can be parent Nodes.
 * 	Nodes at the bottom that does n't have children is called a leaf.
