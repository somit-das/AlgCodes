# **Detailed Analysis of Binary Search**

## **1. Introduction**

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for searching a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It follows a **divide-and-conquer** approach and is significantly faster than linear search for large datasets.

---

## **2. Algorithm**

### **Iterative Approach**

```java
int binarySearch(int arr[], int target) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;  // Avoids overflow
        if (arr[mid] == target)
            return mid; // Found target
        else if (arr[mid] < target)
            low = mid + 1; // Search right half
        else
            high = mid - 1; // Search left half
    }
    return -1; // Element not found
}
```

### **Recursive Approach**

```java
int binarySearchRecursive(int arr[], int low, int high, int target) {
    if (low > high) return -1;
    
    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    
    if (arr[mid] == target) return mid;
    else if (arr[mid] < target)
        return binarySearchRecursive(arr, mid + 1, high, target);
    else
        return binarySearchRecursive(arr, low, mid - 1, target);
}
```

## **3. Time Complexity Analysis**

### **Best Case (O(1))**

- If the target element is at the middle index in the first comparison, the algorithm immediately returns it.

### **Worst Case (O(log N))**

- The worst case happens when the target element is at the last possible position to be checked (first or last index).
- At each step, the search space is reduced by half.
- The recurrence relation follows:
  \[
  T(N) = T(N/2) + O(1)
  \]
  Expanding:
  \[
  T(N) = O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + \dots + O(1)
  \]
  until **N reduces to 1**. Solving:
  \[
  N / 2^k = 1 \Rightarrow k = \log_2 N
  \]
  Hence, **T(N) = O(log N)**.

### **Average Case (O(log N))**

- The average case complexity remains **O(log N)** since each search either succeeds early or reaches the last iteration.

---

## **4. Space Complexity**

### **Iterative Approach (O(1))**

- Uses only a few integer variables (`low`, `high`, `mid`), so space is constant.

### **Recursive Approach (O(log N))**

- Requires a call stack of depth **O(log N)** due to recursive calls.

---

## **5. Worst-case Scenario**

- The worst case occurs when the target element is **at the first or last index** of the array.
- This ensures that we perform the **maximum number of iterations** (â‰ˆ **logâ‚‚(N) comparisons**).

2. **Finding the Last Occurrence of an Element**
3. **Finding the Smallest Element Greater than X (Upper Bound)**
4. **Finding the Largest Element Less than X (Lower Bound)**
5. **Finding an Element in a Rotated Sorted Array**
6. **Binary Search on an Infinite Sorted Array**
7. **Binary Search on a Monotonic Function (Binary Search on Answer)**

2. **Finding Square Roots and Logarithms**
3. **Optimizing Problems (Binary Search on Answer)**
4. **Allocating Resources (Memory, Process Scheduling)**

## In **binary search**, the **worst-case** occurs when the element is found at the last possible comparison. This happens when the search space is repeatedly divided until only one element remains.  

### **Worst-case Position of the Element**

The element should be present at:

1. **Either extreme end** (first or last position of the array).
2. **A position such that it is always in the half that is discarded last.**  
   - This usually happens when the searched element is at the **first or last position** of a sorted array.

### **Worst-case Example**

Consider searching for **`10`** in the sorted array below using binary search:

```
Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]
Target: 10
```

Steps:

1. Check middle â†’ `7` (index 3)  
   - `10 > 7`, search right half.  
2. Check middle â†’ `9` (index 4)  
   - `10 > 9`, search right half.  
3. Only one element left â†’ `10` (index 5)  
   - Found at last step.

Since it took **logâ‚‚(N) + 1** comparisons in the worst case, the element was positioned **at the last index (or first index in a descending array)** to maximize comparisons.

### **Worst-case Time Complexity**

- **O(log N)** comparisons for an array of size **N**.

Thus, in the worst case, the element should be at **either end (first or last position in the array)** to ensure the maximum number of recursive calls before termination.


## Binary Search is one of the most optimal searching algorithms for sorted data, achieving **O(log N)** time complexity. However, there are some algorithms that can perform better under specific conditions. Below are some **better alternatives** to Binary Search depending on the scenario

---

## **1. Interpolation Search (O(log log N))**

**When to use?**  
âœ… When the dataset is **sorted and uniformly distributed** (e.g., sorted IDs, temperature records).  

### **Why is it better?**  

- Unlike binary search, which always jumps to the middle, Interpolation Search **predicts** where the target might be based on values.  
- It performs better than Binary Search when the values are evenly distributed.

### **Algorithm**

Instead of taking the middle element, it estimates the position of the target using:
\[
\text{pos} = \text{low} + \frac{(target - arr[\text{low}]) \times (\text{high} - \text{low})}{(arr[\text{high}] - arr[\text{low}])}
\]
It then refines the search like Binary Search.

### **Time Complexity**

- **Best Case**: **O(1)** (directly jumps to the target).
- **Average Case**: **O(log log N)** (faster than Binary Search for large uniform datasets).
- **Worst Case**: **O(N)** (when elements are not uniformly distributed).

---

## **2. Exponential Search (O(log N))**

**When to use?**  
âœ… When you **donâ€™t know the size** of the sorted dataset (e.g., infinite arrays, streamed data).  

### **Why is it better?**  

- **Faster for unbounded lists** because it doesnâ€™t need to know the size.
- Works like **Binary Search**, but it first finds an appropriate range **exponentially**.

### **Algorithm**

1. **Find the search range** by doubling the index:

   ```
   1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... until arr[index] > target
   ```

2. **Perform Binary Search** in the identified range.

### **Time Complexity**

- **Best Case**: **O(1)**
- **Worst Case**: **O(log N)** (same as Binary Search)
- **Advantage**: Better when working with **infinite** or **unbounded** lists.

---

## **3. Fibonacci Search (O(log N))**

**When to use?**  
âœ… When division operations are expensive (e.g., low-level hardware optimization).  

### **Why is it better?**  

- Uses **Fibonacci numbers** instead of division for search positioning.
- Works better than Binary Search in **memory-constrained systems** (e.g., embedded systems).

### **Algorithm**

1. Generate Fibonacci numbers until one exceeds `N`.
2. Use Fibonacci numbers to partition the array and search iteratively.

### **Time Complexity**

- **Best Case**: **O(1)**
- **Worst Case**: **O(log N)** (similar to Binary Search but avoids division).

---

## **4. Ternary Search (O(log N))**

**When to use?**  
âœ… When searching in a **continuous monotonic function** (e.g., peak finding).  

### **Why is it better?**  

- Unlike Binary Search (which splits into 2 parts), **Ternary Search splits into 3 parts**.
- Works best for **finding extrema (minima/maxima) in unimodal functions**.

### **Time Complexity**

- **O(log N)**, but **more comparisons per step** than Binary Search.

---

## **5. Jump Search (O(âˆšN))**

**When to use?**  
âœ… When working with **linked lists or block-based storage**.  

### **Why is it better?**  

- **Better than Binary Search for linked lists**, since it doesnâ€™t need random access.  

### **Algorithm**

1. Jump in fixed-size steps (`âˆšN`).
2. Perform linear search within that block.

### **Time Complexity**

- **Best Case**: **O(1)**
- **Worst Case**: **O(âˆšN)** (slower than Binary Search).

---

## **6. Groverâ€™s Algorithm (Quantum) â€“ O(âˆšN)**

**When to use?**  
âœ… When using **quantum computing**.  

### **Why is it better?**  

- Groverâ€™s Algorithm is a **quantum algorithm** that searches **unsorted** databases in **O(âˆšN)** instead of O(N).
